# Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

###Tensorflow implementation
  * All the codes in this project are mere replication of [Theano version](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code)

### Code
 * model.py
  * Definition of DCGAN model
 * train.py
  * Training the DCGAN model using face data
 * util.py
  * Image related utils 
 
### Dataset
 * CelebA Face dataset 
  * http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
   * Download "img_align_celeba" images
   * Set "face_image_path" in train.py according to the path of downloaded dataset
